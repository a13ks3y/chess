# Chess

### Description
Just some [chess]() for my wife. She is refused to play chess with me on computer,
and said that she wants to play it in real life with actual chess board and pieces. So I've decided to make my own
version of chess, and hope she will change her mind. 
### How To Play
Just visit this __[link](https://a13ks3y.github.io/chess/).__ and 
### Disclaimer
This is not a chess for playing against AI, it's for playing with
some other person. But probably I will add some AI in future, if will have enough time.  
### Code Style
There is no code style at all. Sorry, I was just cleaning the house and code on the breaks.
