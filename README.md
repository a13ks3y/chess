# Chess

### Description
Just some [chess]() for my wife. She is refused to play chess with me on computer,
and said that she wants to play it in real life with actual chess board and pieces. So I've decided to make my own
version of chess, and hope she will change her mind. 
### How To Play
Just visit this __[link](https://a13ks3y.github.io/chess/).__ 
and move pieces by clicking on the piece that you want to move and then
click on the cell where you want to put your piece.
### Disclaimer
This is __not__ a chess for playing against AI, it's for playing with
some other person. But probably I will add some AI in future, if will have enough time.  
### Code Style
There is no code style at all. Sorry, I was just cleaning the house and code on the breaks.
### Todo
- responsiveness
    - board should take all space on mobile
    - github link in the top right corner should be hidden if the screen size is too small to show it without overlapping.
    - github link should be somewhere at the bottom of the page if the screen size is to small to show it in the top right corner.
- ~~add link to github~~
- ~~hovered piece should has a pointer cursor~~
- add to the left, right, top and bottom of the alphabetic and numeral coordinates
- ~~the figures must eat each other~~
- eaten pieces should be displayed on the side of the board
- pieces of the same color should not eat each other except for pawns that have reached the end of the board and have
entered another piece
- a pawn that has reached the end of the board must turn into another piece of the same color
- if we click first on one figure, then on another, then the first one should eat another
- add castling to possible moves

- figures must walk by the rules
- if I choose a figure, possible moves and actions are highlighted in front of it.
- make it work offline
- ~~make a board flip animation~~
- make logging of moves
